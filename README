=======

First use sysback.sh to make a copy of a working Arch Linux installation
you may have to change few things in it like the destination where to
write the archive of the installation. After that's done extract all the
files to your new root partition (this is assumed to be ext4 for the
rest of this process, if it's not ext4 then change things in mkfstab)
After extraction follow these steps, (you must copy all the scripts
to /scripts)

1. Run chroot-run from this directory(/scripts).
2. Run chroot ../ (from this directory, or cd .. and then chroot .)
3. Run chroot-start from within chroot's shell.
4. You need to edit /etc/fstab manually but a guiding fstab will be 
   there after chroot-start ends, DO NOT BOOT with this fstab. You
   must change the file systems and mount locations manually. The
   mount points will be replaced with your sd* device names for easy 
   identification, you must replace these with the real mount points
   and default file system type is Ext4(the script does no checking)
   so you have to replace that too.
5. Enjoy!
